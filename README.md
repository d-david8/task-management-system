# Red Team: Task Management System

Build a Task Management System for a software development team. The team needs a system to track and manage their
software development tasks, including task assignment, progress tracking, and reporting.

Requirements:
Users (team members) should be able to create new tasks. Each task should include the following details:
Task title
Task description
Due date
Priority (e.g., High, Medium, Low)
Task assignee (team member responsible for the task)

Team members should be able to assign tasks to themselves or other team members.
A task can only have one assignee at a time.
Users should be able to update the progress of tasks. Progress can be tracked as a percentage completion (0-100%).
Users can mark tasks as completed when they are finished.
Users should be able to view a list of all tasks. The list should display task details, including:
Task title
Due date (if set)
Priority
Assignee
Progress status

Users should have the ability to filter and sort tasks based on criteria such as due date, priority, and assignee.
Users should be able to add comments to tasks for discussion and updates.
Users should be able to generate task reports, including:
Task completion summary
Task progress summary
Task assignment summary
Implement email notifications for task assignments, updates, and task completion.
